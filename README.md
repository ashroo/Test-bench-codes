# Test-bench-codes
Test bench code for measurement of Thrust and Torque made for Raspberry Pi. This project include 2 modes. 
1. Without Telemetry - For Motor with ESC that does not have telemetry capabilities.

2. With Telemetry - For Motors with ESC with telemetry capabilities over UART and thus can be read and decoded to find the readings.

Over time this code can be improved.
